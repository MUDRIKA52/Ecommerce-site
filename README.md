## 🔥 Notable Features & Design Choices  

1️⃣ **Redux for Cart Management**
-The cart functionality is managed using Redux, providing a centralized and predictable state management solution.
-Redux ensures efficient state updates, making the cart system scalable and maintainable.
-With Redux, the cart state persists across different components, eliminating the need for prop drilling.


2️⃣ **Redux for Product Data**  
- Product data is managed using **Redux**, ensuring a **centralized state**.  
- Helps in efficiently handling API calls and **minimizing unnecessary re-renders**.  

3️⃣ **Error Handling & Fallback UI**  
- Uses `try-catch` blocks for API calls to prevent app crashes.  
- Displays **user-friendly messages** when errors occur (e.g., **"Category not found"**).  

4️⃣ **Optimized Performance**  
- Uses `useEffect` with **dependency arrays** to prevent **unnecessary API calls**.  
- Implements **event.stopPropagation()** to prevent modal flickers & unwanted clicks.
